## Open (to extension) Closed (to modification)

Opened to extension, closed to modification.  We can extend the functionality of our system without modifying our existing code type of idea.

It is about flexibility.
It is not prescriptive. (it does not answer how)

This is more of a description of two opposing forces that we should balance in some way. It is kind of like aerodynamics

For the behavior of your system to change, something has to change, depending on how you draw the circle around your system the change may be strictly outside of your system… but if the change modifies your system… maybe the change is actually part of your system.
